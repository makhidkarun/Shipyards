Comments: Using a 600-ton TL 14 streamlined hull, the far trader ranges 
far and wide, and deals with every world it finds.

Even amber zones and red zones are not considered off limits by its captains, 
provided there is profit to be made and the risk of being caught is slight. 
It has drives capable of jump-2 and 2-G acceleration. Fuel tankage supports 
jump-2 and two months of operation, and the ship incorporates fuel scoops 
and fuel intakes for wilderness refuelling. The bridge is standard and has a 
computer Model/ 1bis and a basic sensor suite.

There are two hardpoints, but no weapons are mounted. Like the free trader, 
the far trader is built around its cargo bay, in this case just over 300 tons, 
plus passenger staterooms.

A single air/raft is carried for various ship duties. The ship is streamlined, 
and can land on uneven terrain.  The far trader requires a crew of four: 
pilot/astrogator, two engineers, and a steward.
