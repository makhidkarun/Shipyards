# Shipyards
Repository for ship-building programs and ship designs.

# T5
The T5 folder has T5DesktopShipyard, an old Adobe AIR app.
The ACS folder has starships created with this program -- more than 170 designs.
There are also a number of helpful utility scripts in the ACS folder.

# Starports
What's a shipyard without a starport? Docs and utils go here.
